# Meter-Clock-using-a-Real-Time-Clock-Module-RTC-
 Clock displaying the hours minutes and seconds on analog meters and keeping time with a RTC module
This project describes an analog clock using Weston 301 panel meters as the displays for hours, minutes and seconds. The clock uses a Real Time Clock (RTC) Module to obtain the time and then displays the time on the analog meters using the PWM output pins on the Arduino to produce a voltage between 0 and 5 volts DC. The clock incorporates push buttons to set the time, and 3 potentiometers for fine adjustments of each meter.
